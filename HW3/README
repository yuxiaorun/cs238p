note:
part1: use grep -n uptime *.[chS] to see how to add a system call. Follow the uptime example. 
All information needed is in proc->tf.

part2: use ptable.proc[NPROC] to get the proc information. Notice since the ptable is living in proc.c, 
you should write your sys_getprocinfo in proc.c instead of in sysproc.c.
